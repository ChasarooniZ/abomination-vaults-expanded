I <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Strongly</span></span> recommend you pick and choose the elements you like and feel free to change things up (also you can support me <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/chasarooni\">here</a>, <em>but if you had to just pick one support the OG author</em>)<br><em>Also feel free to report any issues </em><a href=\"https://github.com/ChasarooniZ/abomination-vaults-expanded/issues\" title=\"Report issues to me!\"><em>here</em></a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>The Abomination Vaults is an excellent adventure, but like all adventures it is meant to be built upon. Any playthrough will be different, just as every group is different. Every GM will do things a little differently. This is how I did things.</p>\n<p>I have collated most of the changes and additional content I included in my Abomination Vaults game because I know I would have liked to have a resource like this to draw ideas from when I was starting out. In the document, I will explain why I made these changes. You might disagree. That’s fine! Like all such resources, you should take whatever you think will work for your game, and ignore the rest. I hope you can find some of my ideas helpful.</p>\n<p>Here is what this document contains:</p>\n<h3>The Roseguard @UUID[JournalEntry.ZPTalN8eYZyKYfz0]{ }</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>Expanded histories of the Roseguard, from their individual careers before they banded together to their ultimate sad fate following the defeat of Belcorra</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Roseguard artifacts necessary for descending to the 5th level are now more powerful, take more effort to acquire, and grow in ability throughout the adventure</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>The Roseguard remain relevant to the end, and their aid can be enlisted in the final battle against Belcorra by completing a difficult combat/ritual</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Otari NPCs @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj]{ }</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>Otari NPCs have more fleshed-out personalities, motivations, and goals</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Most NPCs have at least one side quest, which is often non-violent in nature to provide a breather from the Vaults; some of these side quests tie into the Troubles in Otari adventure</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Added some new characters, mostly for good reasons</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Changes to the Vaults @UUID[JournalEntry.UTWz996e1nM1OkQ6]{ }</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>Added some traps and puzzles, just for fun</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Expanded the role of the arena into an active coliseum in which the PCs can challenge foes singly or as a party for rewards (see Red Holiday below)</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Several scripted encounters with Caliddo Haruvex in the upper levels</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Urevian is now a Disney villain</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>The lift down from the seventh level breaks after use, trapping party in the eighth level</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Rectified a baffling and inexcusable absence of flumphs in the Darklands</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Implied involvement of the alghollthus in the background of this adventure</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>And more!</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Random Encounter System @UUID[JournalEntry.NrNp6wwO5NKtMfLW]{ }</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>A simple system for running a limited number of random encounters within the vaults,

 <p>Includes rules for a wide variety of games, events, and challenges</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>A theatrical production, which the PCs may be part of</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Mayoral election speeches, and the important introduction of Carman Rajani</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>A harrow reading from Wrin</p>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        <p>Festival ends with the activation of the Gauntlight and the @UUID[JournalEntry.3T1M395V6J75OsEp.JournalEntryPage.bwT6PloCsffN9m73]{Deadtide for Otari} event!</p>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Letters of Dr. Zacchaeus Quagmire III <em>@UUID[JournalEntry.L6vpoyYJbZZmlcrb]{ }</em></h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>A simple treasure hunt through the levels of the vaults, initiated by the ‘treasure map’ found as loot in

This could add a slight complication to the otherwise clear-cut investigation, as Carman is everybody’s obvious assumption for the culprit. Additionally, it is odd that someone was able to steal it at all, for it was guarded by spells and wards to prevent theft. Yet the protective spells have burnt out, and the case was broken from the inside.</p><p>The story is that Amicia Rajani, inspired by recent threats to the town and by the party themselves, has been looking for an opportunity to take up the sword of her ancestor and be a hero. Carman covets the sword for the perceived status it gives him, but Amicia wants to use it the way the Rose Knight did. The Rosa Argentis could detect this, and it broke free of its case to go to her hand. The Rosa Argentis gains additional powers when wielded by a Rajani.</p><p>As described in the adventure, Amicia flees to a cave, expecting that her normal life is over. She plans to run away and become a hero like the Rose Knight. The confrontation with her is unlikely to end in combat, since she does not want to fight, but it may be complicated by the involvement of her father, who does not understand her motives or her actions, and is outraged. This situation could play out in many dramatic ways, but ultimately the PCs will either end up with the sword, or end up with the cooperation of one or both of the Rajanis – who are unwilling to surrender their ancestral weapon. (In my opinion, the random shade fight doesn’t add much to this encounter, so I’d skip it, but that’s up to you.)</p><p>It is possible that the party will end up having to accompany a Rajani or two to the barrier when they are finally ready to bring it down. You can make the breaking of the barrier very dramatic – the Rosa Argentis cleaves through the wall of necromantic energy; you feel the evil eye upon you; etc. If Carman is involved, he will make sure everyone in town knows about this heroic deed, further boosting his popularity in the ongoing election season.</p>"

					"content": "<h2>Urevian The Thespian</h2><p>So I made <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.DQepDGIcXuhkYOuU.JournalEntryPage.t9SSGAP5pW2NpkWh]{Urevian}</strong> a Disney villain, by which I mean he has prepared musical numbers, complete with diegetic background music. (You don’t have to actually sing.) I think this makes him more fun and memorable, and also more menacing in a weird sort of way. Up to you. Because of this change, however, I wanted the party to have at least two separate encounters with Urevian:</p><ul><li><p>The meeting in which he describes his situation and presents his offer</p></li><li><p>And later on when the party either delivers a @UUID[JournalEntry.DQepDGIcXuhkYOuU.JournalEntryPage.hv8jCTjoKEFVFV4Q]{Rajani} or faces him in combat</p></li></ul><p>There may be more interactions – indeed, Urevian is happy to have guests as interesting as the heroes, and he might invite them in for tea and games, all of which have a distinctly sinister, not to mention musical, undertone.</p><h3>Supporting Changes</h3><p>I had to make some changes to make this work. For one thing, the party does not need to collect all four-to-five pieces of the key to Urevian’s door. They will think they have to do that, but in fact <strong>Urevian</strong> will open his door and invite them in once they’ve got two or three.</p><p>He is not interested in ordering the other devils in the area to stand down; it amuses him to see the party and the devils try to kill each other. He will only order his devils not to attack if the party agrees to bring him the soul of a Rajani – and it is very difficult to lie to Urevian. In fact, he might require them sign a contract.</p><h3>Rajani Deal Changes</h3><p>Since I gave <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.YAyvETJXLZZsYobS]{Carman}</strong> a @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.ev0nXNG2KKK8Hk5U]{daughter}, there are two Rajanis in town. Either is acceptable to Urevian. Both is even better, and he promises hefty rewards for both. But he only needs one.</p><p>Now, Carman isn’t a very good person, but the party probably likes @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.ev0nXNG2KKK8Hk5U]{Amicia}, and there is the familial bond between the two of them to consider. This makes Carman sympathetic. We need Urevian to sweeten his end of the deal in order for this to really be a difficult choice for the party.</p><h4>An Offer You Can't Refuse</h4><p>In addition to simply clearing the path down, <strong>Urevian</strong> promises to reveal a secret about @UUID[JournalEntry.DQepDGIcXuhkYOuU.JournalEntryPage.snj2fGhhuxfAInom]{Belcorra} – specifically, her greatest weakness – if the party brings him a Rajani. What is one soul, he argues, weighed against all the destruction Belcorra could wreak if she is not stopped? If he is brought a Rajani, Urevian will tell the party that the only way to truly defeat Belcorra is to focus the gaze of Nhimbaloth upon her, foreshadowing the lenses.</p><p>To tempt the party still further, Urevian might offer quite a lot of gold (say, 200-300 per PC), and a magic @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.idAyVZxTkPSNLbnt]{Quill of Passage}. He may even resort to threatening an attack upon the town of Otari if the heroes remain obstinate. (He won’t threaten in the first meeting.)</p><h4>Increased Security</h4><p>To discourage an immediate attack upon Urevian by a particularly righteous party, we’re replacing his Barbazu guardians with @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-3.Actor.e6r8AGxfp8PDXaZk]{Levalochs}, and we’re changing Urevian’s stats to those of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-monster-core.Actor.3QyqHIuAXE3YVLUh]{Phistophilus} devil’s official statblock (which is one level higher, and more than one level scarier).</p><p>Even assuming your party is running the vaults a level ahead, as mine is, this is still a very difficult encounter, and the party should be made aware of this fact. If the party refuses to consider handing over a Rajani to Urevian, they’ll need to find a way to separate him from his guards, or take his guards out separately, or some other clever plan. They’ll think of something. It's not supposed to be easy.</p><h2>Demontide for Otari</h2><p>Finally, there is a reaction from the depths of Gauntlight when the party deals with Urevian for good, either by defeating him or handing over a Rajani soul.</p><p>The party feels a tangible aura of malice, and a sense of being watched. Regardless of whether they plan to take the lift or the stairs, make sure to warn them that they had best return to town and prepare before venturing further. The party should be aware already that the next level is much deeper down compared to the levels so far, and also more dangerous.</p><p>As the GM, strongly encourage them to return to Otari to rest and stock up. This is for two reasons:</p><ul><li><p>The first is that this will trigger the <strong>@UUID[JournalEntry.1pJDsDbuD4cMiU7S]{Demontide for Otari}</strong> event, which is described in detail elsewhere in this document, and this event works best if it occurs before the players reach the eighth level.</p></li><li><p>The second reason is that the lift will break if the party rides it down, stranding them in the eighth level until they can find and activate the teleport circle or find some other way out.</p></li></ul>"

There is an elemental shrine in the center of this room, which radiates a primal power. A PC skilled in Arcana or Nature might be able to sense that the four guardians will eventually reform (though probably not drop runestones again), and that the planar boundaries are weak here. At this shrine one can sacrifice parts of themselves in exchange for elemental powers!</p><ul><li><p>PCs can sacrifice some of their maximum hit points to gain energy resistance, with a 1-to-1 conversion.

Because this temple was originally constructed by alghollthus. It used to be at the bottom of the sea, after all. And why did Belcorra awaken after centuries of unquiet rest? It wasn’t because of a half-millennia anniversary – it was because the alghollthus (possibly this one in particular) sensed her presence within the <strong>ebony lens</strong> and woke her up by bringing the lens here to the temple. You can go as deep as you want with an implied connection between the Haruvex family and alghollthus.</p><h3>Greater Threat</h3><p>You could imply that Belcorra is merely their puppet, or a tool they are using. You could even set them up as the central villains for a continuation of this adventure, deeper into the depths. What is certain now is that the alghollthus would be altogether pleased for an apocalyptic catastrophe to befall Absalom, and thus they have a vested interest in stopping the PCs.</p><h3>Using Illusions</h3><p>Be sure to make good use of the Veiled Master’s extraordinary illusion powers. It might show players glimpses of the history of this temple, visions of Absalom in ruin, or other imagery intended to terrify and demoralize them. (You could also suggest that all the visions and imagery seen in the @UUID[JournalEntry.yn21bNM6kpV4xRol.JournalEntryPage.HIyVCXXLryTcvTX0]{Second Challenge} were also the work of this Veiled Master.)

This could be Olli from the fishery shack, Wrin, who has just scouted the town in bird form, or any other NPC who you think would have a grasp of the situation. The situation is this: the town is under attack by demons!

You can put them anywhere in town, but you are encouraged to put them with characters or locations that your players are emotionally invested in. The attacks are happening simultaneously. The choice should be clear: the PCs cannot save everyone!</p><p>Each of the four encounters is a low-threat encounter for an <strong>8th level party</strong>. You should add the elite template if your party is <strong>9th level</strong>, or the weak template if your party is <strong>7th level</strong>.

Splitting two ways would be more manageable, but would still result in some tense battles. Whatever they decide, the point is that they cannot save everyone.</p><p>If your party sticks together, they should breeze through one encounter, and you might allow them to deal with a second one just in time to save the day and prevent NPCs death at these two locations. If your party splits in half, they will only have time to deal with these two encounters before the demons overwhelm the townsfolk at the other locations. In the unlikely event that your party splits further than this, deal with each encounter separately, one at a time. If PCs die, so will the NPCs they are assisting.</p><p>Once the party deals with their first fight (or perhaps two fights, if they stuck together), it is too late to rescue the other NPCs. Therefore, you might want to simply narrate the party dispatching the remaining demons in town, or better yet, have your players describe it. You could also include some of the townspeople fighting back, such as Amicia if she has the Rosa Argentis, Klorte Hengus, and Vandy Banderdash.</p><h2>Aftermath</h2><p>Much of the town is in flames, and many are dead. The town recognizes that many more would certainly have perished if not for the actions of the party…but there are also those who argue (correctly) that demons would never have attacked the town in the first place if the party hadn’t gone meddling with that lighthouse! They will try to place the blame for this disaster on the party.</p><p>It should be evident to the players that the <strong>Gauntlight</strong> is still operable, and that <strong>Belcorra</strong> still possesses the means and the will to fulfil her dream of destroying the city of Absalom.</p><p>They, or an ally such as <strong>Wrin</strong>, might surmise that she hasn’t done so yet because she is still building power.

This will foreshadow the fleshwarping later on in the vaults, and might cause the PCs to start asking questions that will be relevant later.</p><p>If the PCs explore the long passage to the third level of the vaults, they will encounter the @UUID[JournalEntry.KeWKr2yd8dbppeS5.JournalEntryPage.2YRUhNAQ8UYfyHAU]{gibbering mouther} and may even unwisely attempt to fight it. Feel free to suggest that they shelve this mystery for now, especially as it clearly has nothing to do with their current fish-theft quest.</p><h2>Area 17</h2><p>In the kobolds’ living quarters, I included a non-aggressive kobold defending a clutch of eggs, which the party will find after cleaning up the rest. This kobold can provide all the usual information as described in the adventure, but she will also provide a tough choice: will the party allow this kobold to flee with her eggs?</p><h3>Lore</h3><p>There is a bit of extra lore that the party might learn as well. When the kobold tribe acquired the dragon egg (which they bought from a traveling goblin merchant that the party will meet later), they had two leaders: <strong>Kolgan</strong> and <strong>Zolgran</strong>. These two were siblings, and both were mages. However, they disagreed about raising the dragon to destroy Otari.</p><p>Kolgan was curious about the surface dwellers, and he had dreams of establishing friendly relations and even trade with the people of Otari. This disagreement turned bitter, and ultimately it resulted in a magical duel. This duel occurred just a few weeks ago, and it resulted in the burning and collapse of one of the surface dwellers’ buildings. This, of course, was the Thirsty Alpaca. Zolgran emerged victorious, but the fate of Kolgan is unknown.</p><p>Kolgan is now called @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.z3K66yDeIIWO2VeX]{Fiver}. He is the kobold currently hiding in the ruins of the @UUID[JournalEntry.PrAuOqj2BsexgBgU.JournalEntryPage.lciBLMecpz62onqH]{Thirsty Alpaca}, who has been befriended in secret by @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.SVAwyWJ9rqu9Qu9C]{Wrin}, as described in the NPCs section of this document. He will later be grieved to learn of the consequences of his sister’s actions for his tribe, but he still harbors idealistic dreams of kobolds and soft-skins living in harmony together. If the party showed mercy and allowed some of the kobolds to escape, this dream might eventually become a reality.</p><h3>Treasure Map</h3><p>For the ‘treasure map’ that the party finds after defeating Zolgran, use the @UUID[JournalEntry.L6vpoyYJbZZmlcrb.JournalEntryPage.hOMUDNapQMRjV1kQ]{first letter of Dr. Zacchaeus Quagmire III}, found later on in this document. This letter found its way here from the vaults, and is the beginning of a linear treasure-hunt sidequest down through the layers of the vaults. The party will likely not understand its significance until later. not only thought this plan risky and unlikely to succeed, but he was less hostile towards the townsfolk of Otari.</p><h2>Wyrmling Changes</h2><p>Finally, make sure to describe the wyrmling as having some kind of distinctive marking or feature, such as vivid blue stripes down one side. Why? Because when the party finds the dragon in the @UUID[JournalEntry.1vlzl3NJsftNB9Dc]{9th level of the vaults}, it will have the same distinctive markings! Yes, @UUID[JournalEntry.1vlzl3NJsftNB9Dc.JournalEntryPage.cwYDvlHWV3sCAa1r]{Ravirex} is this dragon’s father/mother (whichever).</p><p>When the party finishes this adventure, they probably have a few days to a week before the festival. If they need something to do, they could receive @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.c4xoU40Brw88kaPV]{Tamily’s fishing camp sidequest}. Otherwise, introduce the downtime mechanics. On to the @UUID[JournalEntry.6rvn0K6ZQ1LOX6tI]{festival}!</p>"

					"troubles-in-otari": {
						"title": "Troubles In Otari",
						"content": "<p>The short adventure Troubles in Otari consists of a number of quests for characters level 2, 3, and 4. It is intended to be a possible continuation of @UUID[.4jhRn6b0Wz9HrtsK]{The Menace Under Otari}, but it can also be a good source of extra material for the Abomination Vaults.</p><p>However, you probably don’t want to just run the entire Troubles in Otari before starting the vaults, as the party will end up way over-leveled. Running it concurrently is an option, but if you are using XP leveling it will eventually have a similar effect, skewing the balance of the game by giving your players a couple of extra levels.</p><h2>Splitting Them Up</h2><p>In my game, I chopped up the quests from Troubles in Otari, simplified them, and used them as optional side-quests to be offered to the players at certain levels. The key is in simplifying the quests. They should appear to the players as short but rewarding interludes between big dives into the vaults. I would suggest that no single quest from Troubles in Otari should last more than a session. It is entirely up to you how to modify the quests, but here’s how I did it.</p><h3>Fishing Camp</h3><p>For the fishing camp quest, which functions as @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.c4xoU40Brw88kaPV]{Tamily}’s side quest, I simply removed a lot of the less interesting monsters such as the rats, and also the random boar/crocodile encounters. The oozes are good because the party will face oozes later. I recommend switching out the giant centipedes for a centipede swarm, as that will teach the party about fighting swarms (useful for when they met Volluk). Keep the web lurker as a sort of ‘big boss’ for the area.</p><h3>Missing Courier</h3><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.5WshGGAJyJIOEcCL]{Oloro Gallentine}’s side quest is the missing courier from chapter 2 of Troubles. The basilisk encounter is all that is really necessary here, but you can add in the kobolds if you like. For an interesting twist, have petrified kobolds in the area as well, along with two basilisks, and have the kobolds join forces with the party to defeat them. The party might need to make some choices about who to un-petrify with the basilisk blood, with Narala also being an option.</p><h3>Magiloy's Mushrooms</h3><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.XsGAxfhlKFpvjNt1]{Magiloy}’s side quest is the ‘Magiloy’s mushrooms’ bit from chapter 2. This is a simple three-room dungeon. It’s full of undead, and there is already plenty of that in the vaults, so you might shorten it a bit, focus more on traps than enemies, or even bring in some of the enemies from chapter 3 of Troubles.</p><h3>Log Fume Fire</h3><p>@UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.HQzvM8DtRYFNiWA5]{Klorte}’s side quest regarding the flume fires is now in connection with Credence and Cryde, not the Leadbuster Lads. See the @UUID[JournalEntry.2hfULzZn5NL03aDy.JournalEntryPage.4jhRn6b0Wz9HrtsK]{Kortos Conspiracy} section of this document for the details.</p><h3>In the Stinkweed</h3><p>The ‘In the Stinkweed’ quest from chapter 2 is now in connection with @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.IncxbKBSG8ei6SXL]{Jale Highstepper} of the Farmer’s Guild. I modified it so that instead of rescuing a herbalist the party is investigating a mysterious blight on the crops. I also made this a higher-level encounter and used regular shamblers rather than stinkweed shamblers. I also involved an arboreal reaper who could be reasoned with.</p><h3>Leadbuster Lads</h3><p>The Leadbuster Lads are now one single, large quest, which is given to the party by @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.xs3sDcCUL2pjEbtq]{Captain Longsaddle}. The Lads do not work for the Kortos Consortium (that’s Credence and Cryde now); instead, they are simply a dangerous group of outlaws and highwaymen. I gave them all different types of firearms for fun. All four of the Leadbuster Lads are together in Maunder Castle, but a clever party might be able to split them and deal with them separately. If the party faces all four Leadbuster Lads together, it will be a difficult encounter.</p><h3>Under Three Eyed Gaze</h3><p>‘Under the Three-Eyed Gaze,’ chapter 3 of Troubles, is a side quest given to the party by @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.Ez5qEE27mhH5dbKy]{Vandy Banderdash}. This is a tricky one because it’s hard to split up, and it’s probably too big to run as-written in the midst of the Abomination Vaults. My solution was to drastically simplify it, leaving only my favorite bits. After all, more dungeon is not what you need if you’re running the Abomination Vaults. So here is what I kept:</p><ul><li><p>All the puzzles and hazards</p><p>The harpies</p><p>The gargoyle and mimic pranksters</p><p>The final temple encounter</p></li></ul>"

					"leveling": {
						"title": "Leveling",

Maybe this is fine for your party, especially if you intend to run a low-lethality game, but for most groups you will want to make adjustments.</p><p>One option is to use the slow-leveling rules. Make sure to talk to your players and decide how to handle this together.</p><h2>Milestone Quest Spacing</h2><p>If you use milestone leveling based off of progress through the vaults, you will have to be careful to space out the sidequests so that your players don’t end up doing a dozen sessions of side content without leveling up. If you use milestone leveling, you need to ensure that players are motivated to complete side quests. This would be a bigger problem in a system like 5e, but Pathfinder 2e gives plentiful rewards in the form of magic items and gold (which is useful in this system), and this can make the pursuit of side quests feel worthwhile even if they don’t directly contribute towards gaining levels. There are also narrative rewards to consider, but those will depend on your players.</p><h2>Adjustments to encounters</h2><p>Either way, if you begin with the Beginner Box adventure and then move on to the vaults, consider slapping the Elite template on everything in the vaults, thus raising the effective level of the entire adventure by 1. Note that the Elite template is not a perfect leveling conversion; lower-level enemies might end up feeling stronger than intended. Its effects are most potent on single boss monsters, and you might want to add an extra enemy or two rather than use the Elite template on a monster this is already party level +3. This is a more balanced solution, but requires more work. Overall, though, the Elite template should work out all right, especially if your party has five players, or if they are experienced. You might want to avoid upping the level of the vaults and running it as-written, with your players a level ahead, if:</p><ul><li><p>Your group wants a low-lethality game</p><p>Your group is inexperienced or new to the system</p><p>Your group has three players</p></li></ul><p>Be sure to make this decision with your players.</p>"

Credence and Cryde, on falsified authority, have investigated the inner financial workings of this lumber company, and found that the numbers don’t add up.</p><h2>Reasons for Tax Fraud</h2><p><strong>Lady Alymora Inkleholtz</strong> has been committing tax fraud. She has not been doing this for selfish reasons; rather, she has been eating financial losses so that she needn’t cut her workers’ pay. Additionally, she is investing a lot of money into her dream of having a real school in Otari, with real education for its children. Despite these sympathetic mitigating circumstances, Credence and Cryde feel they have no choice but to report the fraud to the proper authorities, putting the company on financially shaky ground…unless Lady Inkleholtz signs a deal with the Kortos Consortium. Not only will C&amp;C forget the tax fraud, but the Kortos Consortium is prepared to make a large financial contribution toward her school project.</p><p>This, of course, is blackmail and extortion. Yet Lady Inkleholtz is considering it. She would not be signing away her entire company (not yet), but making the deal would grant the Kortos Consortium an uncomfortable degree of leverage over her business. She knows this, but wonders if her school project, and the continuing livelihoods of her workers, are not worth it.</p><h3>Involving the Party</h3><p>The PCs might become aware of this by hearing rumors, by observing an obviously tense interaction between Lady Inkleholtz and C&amp;C, or even by a direct run-in with the Lady herself, who is understandably upset about the situation.</p><p>The PCs might conclude that this really has nothing to do with them, and they would be correct, but the more perceptive of them might suspect that this is merely one step in a much larger and more sinister scheme. (If they don’t suspect this, an NPC such as Wrin who learns of the situation might voice this idea.) If the PCs decide not to act, score up a win for Credence and Cryde, and afterward drop some obvious clues about the true motives of C&amp;C. For instance, the PCs notice them in a nighttime meeting with a shadowy informant, reporting that the economic takeover of this town will be ‘simple.’</p><h3>\"Solving\" the Encounter</h3><p>If they do decide to act, what might they do? They can’t un-commit Lady Inkleholtz’s tax fraud, but an enterprising party might invent a new business plan for Lady Inkleholtz, propose some sound investments, argue for leniency from the local authorities (in this case, Oseph Menhemes), or even simply convince her that taking the deal is a bad idea – though she is unlikely to agree without a very convincing argument! (You could use a skill challenge for the effort of convincing her, as described in the Absalom sidequest section of this document.)</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>Again, it is your decision what makes a ‘success.’ This is one of the trickiest out of the five scenarios, and it’s fine for Credence and Cryde to get a ‘win’ right away, as this ramps up the tension for future encounters.</p>"

					"the-consortium-conspiracy": {
						"title": "The Consortium Conspiracy",
						"content": "<p>It is implied in the Abomination Vaults adventure that the encroachment of the Kortos Consortium could be a plot hook for the players. It is made more explicit in the Troubles in Otari adventure. I decided to remove the Consortium side quest from the Leadbeater Lads and give to a couple of new, original characters. This side quest consists of a handful of non-combat scenarios, in which the players will match wits and skills with some unusual foes. If that is of interest to you, then read on.</p><h2>One More Property</h2><p>The Kortos Consortium does not have a total monopoly on lumber on the isle of Kortos, but they are looking for one. Otari is one of the last major bastions of local lumber businesses, which the Consortium finds disagreeable as the competition forces them to price their stock reasonably. For a long time, the Kortos Consortium has had the goal of incorporating the three lumber companies of Otari, and now they see the opportunity. The past few years have been rough for the lumber companies of Otari – partly due to random circumstance and partly due to the Consortium exerting economic pressure on them.</p><h2>Wrab's Deal</h2><p>But now the Consortium has an in-road. Chertel Timber is in trouble, and although this is not widely known, the business is close to folding. <strong>Wrab Chertel</strong> has cut a deal with the Kortos Consortium: he’ll support their economic takeover of Otari’s lumber industry, and in return he’ll be made manager of the Otari branch of the Consortium’s lumber monopoly. Wrab Chertel’s motives are not entirely selfish; he has children and even grandchildren to think about. Furthermore, for many people in Otari, life would continue more or less normally. But the <strong>Menhemes</strong> and <strong>Inkleholtz</strong> families will lose their businesses if the Consortium takes over, and life will become harder for the working-class lumberjacks who make up a large percentage of Otari’s population. The Kortos Consortium doesn’t believe in unions, sustainable work-life balance, or safe working conditions. They believe in profits.</p><h2>Credence And Cryde</h2><p>And so, to bring their plans to fruition, they have hired two of the best in the business: <strong>Credence and Cryde</strong>. <strong>Credence and Cryde</strong> bill themselves as <em>‘freelance accountants,’</em> and while they are certainly unparalleled in their mastery of legal and financial matters, they also possess a variety of more discreet talents. Their business card (which can be burned to establish a brief magical line of communication with them) includes the bullet points: “books balanced,” “problems solved,” “no loose ends.” In short, Credence and Cryde are skilled spies, saboteurs, private investigators, and even, so the rumors claim, assassins.</p><p>Credence and Cryde have taken a job from the Kortos Consortium: undermine the Whistledown Cutters and Otari Lumber companies, pressuring them to sell out to the Consortium. And unless the PCs intervene, they will succeed.</p><h3>The C &amp; Cs</h3><p>They are both impeccably professional in their mannerisms and behavior. They are lawful neutral, always honoring their contracts to the best of their abilities. They don’t mind getting their hands dirty, but they avoid unnecessary bloodshed – not out of virtue, but out of a sense of professionalism. They dress in fine dark suits, nearly identical. Credence does the talking; Cryde handles the paperwork. They often communicate in sign language because Cryde is mute.</p><h4>Keppler Credence</h4><p>Keppler Credence is a male tengu. He wears a broad dark hat and carries a sword cane. In terms of class, Credence is an investigator with many skills and an uncanny ability to make accurate deductions about people and situations, so that he nearly seems psychic. </p><h4>Kairo Cryde</h4><p>Kairo Cryde is a mute female dwarf. She wears dark, circular spectacles and carries a briefcase. Cryde is a wizard who casts her spells using fulus, or strips of paper with symbols written upon them. If you don’t want to learn the fulu rules, simply flavor her spellcasting as using these papers. It’s pretty much like casting from scrolls, but without the need for verbal components. She also has a calligraphy wyrm familiar named Callisto, who often takes the form of a golden fountain pen.</p><h3>Indirect Conflict</h3><p>Although they have stats, which can be found at the @UUID[.gaLWAo3Wuv08khgQ]{bottom of this section}, Credence and Cryde are intended to present a different kind of challenge to the players than combat. For one thing, they will go to great lengths to avoid direct combat, even though they are easily capable of defeating a low-level party, as this would draw attention and is simply messy. For another thing, it may be difficult for the party to justify direct violence against Credence and Cryde since they generally give the appearance of doing things legally. For example, if they are found breaking and entering into someone’s house, they will produce a warrant. (The warrant is fake, but only a PC with Expert proficiency in Society has a chance of detecting this.)</p><p>Additionally, Credence and Cryde are both very intelligent. If you, like me, are not very intelligent in real life, you’ll need to use some tricks to get this across to your players:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Well Researched. </strong>Credence will seem to know a lot about the PCs even if they have just met, as a result of his deductive skills</p></li><li><p><strong>Spell Prepared. </strong>Cryde keeps her spell fulus in her briefcase, and she seemingly has exactly the right spell for any given situation</p></li><li><p><strong>Research Grindset. </strong>C&amp;C do their research; after their first encounter with the PCs, they will become aware of the party’s backgrounds, relationships, and weaknesses – including material for leverage or blackmail</p></li><li><p><strong>In Control. </strong>C&amp;C never appear to be surprised by anything, and always give the impression of being in full control of the situation</p></li></ul><h3>Victory Point System</h3><p>The Consortium Conspiracy consists of five simple scenarios that may be brought to the attention of the party. If the party intervenes (successfully) in three out of the five – congratulations! They have thwarted the Kortos Consortium…for now. If you think that five is too many, you could do best of three instead. The scenarios are intended to be fairly short (a session or less in length) and open-ended; let the players figure out how to deal with them. It is up to you to decide what constitutes a ‘success’ or ‘failure.’</p><p>Here are the scenarios, listed with ideas for how the party might become aware of them, a bit of background, and some ideas of how they might respond.</p>"

						"content": "<p>As part of their project to sabotage the lumber companies of Otari, Kairo Cryde has been writing instructional letters to a pirate of her acquaintance who sails the nearby seas. In these letters, she describes the route, defenses, and cargo of the lumber barges leaving Otari. She delivers these letters by folding them into highly durable magic paper planes, which she launches over the city. These paper planes unerringly fly out to meet <strong>Captain Bellafide</strong> of the Dread Design. They are written in the Gnoll language, as Captain Bellafide is a gnoll.</p><h3>Signs of Piracy</h3><p>Several successful raids have already been carried out on the lumber barges, and most of the good lumber, which the pirate vessels can’t carry, is dumped into the sea. Mayor Oseph and Lady Inkleholtz are already aware that an unusual volume of piracy is crippling their businesses.</p><h3>Additional Hook</h3><p>Some NPCs in Otari have noticed these planes, and might point them out to the players. You could even have a player notice them. They are infrequent, only appearing when a merchant vessel leaves Otari laden with lumber, an event which happens on average several times a week in the busy summer season.</p><h2>Stages</h2><p><strong>Stage One. </strong>Attempt to catch one of these planes, which can be as difficult and amusing as you like.</p><p><strong>Stage Two. </strong>Finding out what the paper plane says, and where it is headed.</p><p><strong>Stage Three. </strong>Figuring out what to do about it. Even if the players can trace the planes back to <strong>Kairo Cryde</strong>, it will be nearly impossible to prove her authorship.</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>Possible solutions could include alerting the Absalom Navy and thus laying a trap for <strong>Captain Bellafide</strong>, assigning allies to watch the skies and take down these planes whenever a barge leaves (maybe offering a reward), or even catching a letter, altering its contents in a way designed to solve this problem, and then releasing it again.</p>"

						"title": "The Loading Flume Fire",
						"content": "<p>As part of their goal of sabotaging the lumber companies of Otari, Credence and Cryde have set their sights on one of the town’s most prominent features: the loading flume. It would be very costly for Oseph Menhemes to replace if something were to happen to it, and in the meantime normal shipping of lumber would be slowed. If the loading flume were to suffer an unfortunate accident, the Kortos Consortium could step in and offer a predatory loan, or even rebuild the flume out of their own enormous pocket in exchange for controlling stock options in Otari Lumber.</p><h2>A Foretold Disaster</h2><p>This one starts with <strong>Wrin</strong> and <strong>Klorte Hengus</strong>. The two have an unlikely friendship, and Klorte has always been the type who wants to get his fortune told. This time, Wrin foresaw a terrible disaster in his future – the log flume all aflame! Concerned by this possibility, Klorte went to inspect the flume…and he noticed odd symbols scratched like graffiti onto some of the main support posts. After asking around, Klorte also heard from locals that someone had recently been seen lurking about the flume at night. When Klorte returned the next day, he found even more strange symbols, as well as odd papers pinned to the ground with nails, which disintegrated when he tried to move them. Fearful of the involvement of ghosts or the supernatural, Klorte returns to Wrin to ask for advice, who in turn directs him to the PCs.</p><h3>C&amp;C's Plan</h3><p>The truth is that Credence and Cryde have been preparing a magical ritual that will turn the loading flume into a mass of crumbling ash. The ancient and well-treated logs of the flume would be rather difficult to light with a normal fire, unless that fire were large indeed, and even then only a section of the flume might fully burn. C&amp;C are aiming for something a little more dramatic and complete. They intend to frame this disaster on local outlaws – possibly the Leadbuster Lads, if you’re using them – but their planted evidence will be to no avail if the PCs catch them.</p><h3>The Party's In</h3><p>It won’t be too difficult for the party to creep up on Credence and Cryde in the night as they are preparing to conduct their ritual. The PCs might notice Kairo Cryde throwing her fulus on key points of the structure, then returning to a ritual circle which they have cleared on the rocky ground beneath the flume. Naturally, the party will step in to interrupt the proceedings at some point. Credence and Cryde know that they cannot both conduct the ritual and fight the party; furthermore, security will no doubt be tight around the loading flume after this. So, they activate the partially-completed ritual, and flee! They make sure to flee in such a way that the PCs are able to chase after them, because their plan is to lure the party away from the loading flume long enough for the partially-completed conflagration ritual to do its work.</p><h4>Bad Choices</h4><p><strong>The players have a choice:</strong> attempt to chase Credence and Cryde across town (in which case you should run a short chase sequence), or stay and attempt to stop the spread of the fire on the flume (in which case you should run a skill challenge, as described in the spellbook-heist section of this document). You can discourage them from attempting to split the party and do both by pointing out that half the party is probably not enough to stop the spread of the fire. Unless, of course, you don’t mind running a chase and a skill challenge concurrently.</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>Of course, even if caught in the chase, the freelance accountants prove too slippery to detain for long. If the party chased Credence and Cryde, the loading flume goes up in flames and this counts as a victory for the Kortos Consortium even if the party succeeded in the chase sequence. At this point, Credence and Cryde might be getting truly annoying by all of the party’s interference in their plans. In fact, your players may have already bested them several times before, leading them to suspect they’ll have to report this project as a failure to their clients. Even if this is the case, there is one more card they can play…</p>"

					"the-rigged-election": {
						"title": "The Rigged Election",
						"content": "<p>This scenario, which makes a good finale to the Consortium Conspiracy arc, should take place prior to the party’s dealings with Urevian. In fact, it is ideal if this scenario comes up just before Urevian makes his offer and requests the soul of a Rajani. The party might be tempted to kill two birds with one stone.</p><h2>Carman's Campaign</h2><p>Throughout the business with Credence and Cryde up to this point, the party may have noticed their involvement with Carman Rajani. Indeed, they may be suspicious of this ever since Carman’s oddly eloquent mayoral campaign speech. Throughout the adventure thus far, you could also drop hints and clues that Carman’s current election campaign is going very well for him. He has been making generous (suspiciously generous) contributions to a number of charities and funds, which has rapidly increased his popularity across wide swaths of the voting populace. He has made several powerful speeches. He has seemingly cleaned up his act, and rumors of his various positive qualities are swirling through the town. With Mayor Oseph busy with a struggling business and distracted with the illness of his daughter, Carman Rajani increasingly seems like a real contender for the upcoming election day. (If Credence and Cryde succeeded in discovering Mayor Oseph’s compromising donations to his brother, this will also be detrimental to his campaign.)</p><h2>Their Groundwork</h2><p>Of course, this is all thanks to a lot of behind-the-scenes work from Credence and Cryde. They have laid the groundwork for Carman’s victory in the upcoming election, but they aren’t going to leave it to chance. They intend to make sure that Carman becomes mayor, and there are plenty of ways that a mayor essentially owned by the Kortos Consortium can pave the way for the Consortium’s economic takeover of the town. Imply that Credence and Cryde, being clever and extremely well-versed in legal minutiae, will be able to find all sorts of loopholes and technicalities through which Carman could abuse his power. If you need an example of this, reveal that it is within the mayor’s power to make things very difficult for unions, including the lumberjack’s union headed by Sasha Thane, which is one of the Consortium’s biggest obstacles.</p><h3>Amicia's Insight</h3><p>The players may very well have figured all this out already, in which case they may take the initiative on this one. But if they don’t, it is Amicia Rajani, Carman’s daughter, who comes to them with her concerns. By this point, the PCs have dealt with her already, and she probably trusts them. She knows that her father has been meeting frequently with those shady accountants, and she suspects what they are doing with the election. Amicia doesn’t believe her father will be a good mayor, and more importantly, she doesn’t believe that her father will be happy as mayor. She thinks he’s just trying to prove himself. <em>(This is true, but not the whole story. Carman is motivated by his pride, but also by a desire to be someone that his daughter can look up to, someone she can rely on. There are possibilities here for dramatic, heartfelt character development.)</em></p><h2>The Plan</h2><p><strong>Credence and Cryde have a simple plan:</strong> rig the election votes to make sure <strong>Carman Rajani</strong> wins. Election day is a holiday, and every eligible person who wants to vote simply drops by the <strong>Otari Garrison</strong>, and casts a ballot under the watchful eye of Lardus Longsaddle. Traditionally, the voting ends at sundown, but technically it lasts until midnight, and <strong>Longsaddle</strong> is a stickler for technicalities. Therefore the garrison is open, but mostly empty, from dusk till midnight. The paper ballots are all kept in a locked wooden box, and Lardus, along with a few of the senior garrison officers, count the votes in the morning, tally them up, and announce the results. Otari is a small enough town that this is all a fairly casual operation. They usually get fewer than a thousand votes.</p><p>Credence and Cryde intend to infiltrate the garrison at night and verify that Carman won the election. If he did not, they will alter an appropriate number of the ballots. The party, of course, can try to prevent this, and possibly succeed.</p><h3>The Twist</h3><p>But the twist is that meddling with the ballots was not necessary for Credence and Cryde. Their campaign assistance (and simple bribery) was effective, and <strong>Carman Rajani</strong> really did win, though by a slim margin. The PCs would have to investigate the ballots to determine this, and might opt to meddle with the results themselves! If they don’t, <strong>Carman Rajani</strong> will be announced as the next mayor of Otari, much to the consternation of <strong>Captain Longsaddle</strong>.</p><h4>Complications</h4><p>This counts as a big win for the <strong>Kortos Consortium</strong>, and heralds troubling times for <strong>Otari</strong>, since even on his first day Carman may show worrying signs of letting the position of mayor get to his head. Because of this, the PCs might be more willing to consider Urevian’s offer. Alternatively, Carman might be brought to his senses by the combined efforts of the party and his daughter. How all of this plays out is up to you.</p>"

						"title": "Concluding the Consortium Conspiracy",
						"content": "<p>If you plan on doing a simple best-of-five for this arc, you must make it very clear when the party has either won or lost, both in the individual scenarios and for the whole thing. Win or lose, Credence and Cryde should leave town. Win or lose, Credence and Cryde have come to harbor professional respect for the party’s skills and tenacity. They have no hard feelings, even if the party has thwarted them at every turn. Whatever the outcome, they will give the players some business cards, in the hope that the players know who to call if they ever find themselves in need of ‘freelance accountants.’</p><h3>Devil's Help</h3><p>It is also possible that Credence and Cryde can assist the party in dealing with devils on the seventh floor of the vaults – or vice versa! The devils and the freelance accountants are a match for each other when it comes to writing and deciphering complicated contracts. Either will be happy to analyze any contracts provided by the other – for a fee, of course. They will both automatically succeed at finding all the hidden clauses and fine print.</p><h3>Reward</h3><p><strong>What about rewards?</strong> Most side quests mentioned in this document offer substantial rewards in the form of loot and treasure, but Credence and Cryde are not intended to be looted, or even faced directly in combat. I suggest that you hand out some narrative rewards for a party’s success in the Consortium Conspiracy. What this looks like will vary from game to game, but a narrative reward is something in-game that furthers the goals of the heroes, even side-projects that have nothing to do with Belcorra or the vaults. Maybe one of them wants to open their own shop someday. Maybe one of them is looking for romance. Whatever it is, you can have events play out in their favor as a result of ‘saving’ the town from the schemes of the Kortos Consortium. This often means a lot more to your players than a pile of gold.</p>"

					"mischief-in-menhemes-manor": {
						"title": "Mischief in Menhemes Manor",
						"content": "<p>Credence and Cryde are always on the hunt for informational leverage. They have already discovered <strong>Lady Inkleholtz’s</strong> tax fraud, but Mayor Oseph’s financial records are squeaky clean. His professional and private lives have both been remarkably free of scandal, in spite of accusations made by <strong>Carman Rajani</strong> and other malcontents. But everybody has secrets, especially the powerful. Therefore, Credence and Cryde have decided to utilize their considerable capacity for stealth and subterfuge by sneaking into the Menhemes manor in search of the compromising documents they are certain they will find.</p><h3>C&amp;C's Goal</h3><p>If they succeed, they will locate receipts for a number of large, discreet payments to <strong>Oseph’s</strong> younger brother, Joseph Menhemes, who has recently begun a milling business in Maravon. Oseph has been generously funding his brother’s up-and-coming business project. Oseph views this as a shrewd investment, and it is perfectly legal, but Credence and Cryde will be able to spin these payments as nepotism from a rich lumber tycoon, as well as violations of a number of obscure regional finance laws. This could potentially cause a lot of trouble for Otari Lumber by frightening away investors and tarnishing Oseph’s well-earned reputation for fairness.</p><h3>Botched Robbery</h3><p>Last night, <strong>Credence and Cryde</strong> broke into Menhemes manor. They are very sneaky, but miscalculated the threat posed by Ichabod Shoakes, the manor’s aging but perceptive butler. <strong>Mr. Shoakes</strong> noticed the open window, and the unlocked office door, and the smell of fresh ink (which always seems to hang about Kairo Cryde). He could not locate the intruders, but he strongly suspects their presence, and although nothing was stolen, he believes they might try again.</p><h3>Dorianna Tie In</h3><p>If the party has already assisted <strong>Dorianna Menhemes</strong>, they no doubt have the trust and gratitude of the entire Menhemes family, and Shoakes will ask them to investigate. If you run this adventure while Dorianna is ill, the PCs might be approached for assistance while they are in the manor speaking to her. You might even have Dorianna, who is after all psychic, be the initiator, asking the party to investigate the strange and sinister presences she sensed within the manor the night before. If this scenario coincides with the investigation into Dorianna’s illness, the party might erroneously conclude that her illness is the work of Credence and Cryde! If they confront C&amp;C about this, C&amp;C are insulted. The relationship between Dorianna’s illness and the mission of their current contract is oblique at best, and they would not harm an innocent teenage girl without a very good reason.</p><h3>Party's Options</h3><p>However you choose to introduce the scenario, the party has a few options.</p><ul><li><p>They might attempt an investigation to determine who broke into the manor and what they were looking for. If they do this, they might deduce that the intruders were interrupted in their efforts, and are likely to try again.</p></li></ul><p>In either case, a stakeout is the probable result, the party attempting to lay a trap for the intruders. In this reversal of the typical stealth encounter, it is the party who are standing guard.</p><p>To make things simpler, you could have the bulk of the Menhemes family traveling when this happens, or even visiting someone overnight due to the possibility that violence might occur in the manor. This way, the manor is empty save for the party and Mr. Shoakes, who aids them in standing guard.</p><h3>Running the Encounter</h3><p>Credence and Cryde’s stealth modifiers are listed in their @UUID[.gaLWAo3Wuv08khgQ]{entries below}. Additionally, they will likely be invisible. Their goal is to reach either the mayoral office or the lumber office, and have a look through the paperwork. (Oseph has an office for each of his jobs, each in a different wing of the manor, as an aid to keeping them separate from each other.) They might try tricks such as putting PCs to sleep magically, distracting them with illusions, or even making a commotion somewhere in the hopes of luring the whole party to that location while the other of them goes for the paperwork. Credence and Cryde will avoid direct combat if possible, and in the event that they become cornered or are forced to retreat, they will flee using magical assistance (fly, dimension door, or invisibility are good options). Don’t forget that Kairo has a calligraphy wyrm familiar, named Callisto, who is very cute and might also try to distract or mislead the party.</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>It is up to you whether the party’s efforts are sufficient for success. If either Credence or Cryde reaches an office and has a space of about ten minutes therein, they will find the aforementioned sensitive documents. If the PCs disrupt their plans and catch them in the act, forcing them to flee, Mayor Oseph will realize their goals and will take precautionary steps, making it impossible in the future for C&amp;C to discover any potentially-compromising documents.</p>"

The Eclipse in the evil future is a dire omen indeed. Of course, it refers to the fact that if the party does not stop Belcorra, the city of Absalom will be destroyed!)</p></li></ul><h4>Attribute Fortune</h4><p>After this, separate the deck into six stacks based on attributes. Have each PC randomly draw from whichever pile they feel most closely represents their character, and interpret that card for the future appropriately. This one is actually random.</p><h3>I Saw the Gauntlight Glow</h3><p>The party and Wrin might talk for a while, but at some point, Wrin senses something. She emerges from the tent in alarm and stares to the northwest. “Can you see it?” she asks. She is surprised when the party replies that, yes, they can also see the eerie blue glow emanating from the Gauntlight, the peak of which is just visible above the trees.</p><p>The blue glow narrows into a beam, which aims itself at…the graveyard? It lingers for a few more seconds, then winks out. Ominous…</p><p>Possibly the PCs will want to investigate this right away, and set out to make the several-mile journey from their position to the graveyard. Or they might want to continue hanging out at the festival. Either way, they soon encounter an out-of-breath acolyte from the library.</p><h3>Deadtide for Otari</h3><p>Hysteric with panic, he reports that the dead have risen in the graveyard! Lots of them! Some are leaping from the cliff and raining down upon the library; others are wandering the graveyard.</p><p>Worse another of the acolytes is trapped in a gardening shed inside the graveyard! If someone doesn’t hurry and rescue her, she will be torn to pieces.</p><p>The PCs will probably leap to action; if they hesitate, Wrin suggests they start living up to their brand-new title as protectors of the town. The acolyte and Wrin go to warn @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.Ez5qEE27mhH5dbKy]{Vandy Banderdash} and the <strong>Garrison</strong> respectively.</p><p>Thus the party will arrive at the @JournalEntry[Abomination Vaults]{Deadtide for Otari} event several minutes before backup comes, and when they arrive they will find a graveyard full of wandering dead.</p><h3>Trapped Acolyte</h3><p>A shed some distance within is surrounded by zombies and skeletons. Start the party at the other end of the battlemap so that it takes at last one turn just to get close. At the end of the fourth round of combat, the shed is broken, and the poor acolyte has no choice but to try to make a break for it. Roll her into initiative and give her 12 AC and 10 HP. She isn’t likely to get far without the party’s protection!</p><h3>Spider Killing Backup</h3><p>If the PCs burn easily through the undead, and they might, don’t give them time to rest before dropping the @Actor[scalathrax] on them. When the scalathrax arrives, so does backup for the PCs in the form of <strong>Wrin</strong> and <strong>Vandy</strong>. Vandy goes down the cliff to protect her library; Wrin holds off zombies so that the party can focus on the new beast without distractions. Show that Wrin is kind of a badass, shredding zombies with spray of stars and other spells while the party struggles with the @Actor[scalathrax].</p>"

					"title": "AV:E - Random Encounter System",
					"random-encounter-system": {
						"title": "Random Encounter System",
						"content": "<p>No megadungeon is complete without a chance of random encounters! It is fun for the players because it adds tension and risk, and really makes the dungeon feel alive and dangerous. On the other hand, this is a combat-heavy adventure already, and you don’t want to bombard your party with a constant stream of meaningless extra encounters.</p><h3>Purpose</h3><p>That’s why I created this system. It will slowly increase the chance of a random encounter the more time that the party spends recovering in the dungeon, but there is also a limit on how many encounters can occur. Even if you use this system, you may very well end up with only a handful of random encounters throughout the entire adventure. That’s fine! It only takes a couple to really etch that valuable sense of risk and danger into the party.</p><h4>Difficulty Explained</h4><p>Below is a list of moderate-difficulty encounters for levels 1-12. There are five ‘tiers’ of encounter threat in this system: trivial, low, moderate, severe, and extreme. The system is designed in such a way that a change in the party’s level alters any given encounter’s difficulty on a 1-to-1 basis. For example: a moderate-threat encounter for a 4th-level party would be a low-threat encounter for a 5th-level party, or an extreme-threat encounter for a 2nd-level party. Thus, we only need one list of moderate-threat encounters to be able to create encounters of varying difficulty for a party of any level.</p><h4>Adjustments</h4><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>all of the creatures on this list have the </em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Elite template</span></em></span><em> unless otherwise specified. (This is included already in the table + Macro)</em></p><p>Why did I do this? Because my party did the beginner box adventure first, so I ran the vaults one level ahead. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">If you are starting from level one on the first level</span></span> of the vaults, simply <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">don’t use the Elite template</span></span> (or add the Weak template for those creatures in the list that were not already Elite), and reduce all encounter levels by one.</p><h3>Encounter Timing Mechanics</h3><p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong> The party has a cumulative 5% chance of a random encounter for each hour in the vaults (rounded up) that the party spends resting/healing between fights. If they take a beating and spend 80 minutes treating wounds, this is a 10% chance of a random encounter. Roll a [[/r d20]], and on a 2 or lower, an encounter happens. At your discretion, if they spend a considerable amount of time doing other activities, such as searching through the library on the third level, this will also add to the ever-increasing chance of a random encounter. The chance of a random encounter resets whenever the party takes a long rest outside of the vaults. (It just keeps ticking up if they decide to try for a long rest while within the vaults, but most likely your group will retreat to Otari for their long rests, as is sensible.)</p><p>@UUID[Macro.5s9MzrKHR6PWHpqE]{AV:E - Roll Random Encounter}</p><table><thead><tr><th>[[/r d10]]</th><th>Threat Level</th><th>Encounter Difficulty</th><th>Level Adjustment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Trivial</td><td>Party Level - 2</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>2-3</td><td>Low</td><td>Party Level - 1</td><td>-1</td></tr><tr><td>4-7</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Party Level</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>8-9</td><td>Severe</td><td>Party Level + 1</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Extreme</td><td>Party Level + 2</td><td>+2</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You could remove the chance of an extreme encounter if you think that is too spicy for a random encounter system (When the dice rolls a 10). If you don’t, then make sure your players understand the strategic viability of running away.</p><h4>One Use</h4><p><strong>Important:</strong> each encounter on the table can happen only once! If it is ever rolled again, replace it with atmospheric dressing, like eerie sounds, an ominous sense of being watched, or even a vision of ghosts/Belcorra. This means that there is a hard cap on the number of potential random encounters, even in the unlikely event that you roll all of them.</p><h4>Pay to Play</h4><p>Finally, some of these enemies are taken from Ron Lundeen’s GM Guide for the Abomination Vaults, which is available on Pathfinder Infinite. (Ron Lundeen is a Paizo developer who helped create the adventure!) (<a href=\"https://www.pathfinderinfinite.com/product/373876/Abomination-Vaults-GMs-Guide\">Abomination Vaults GMs Guide</a>)</p><p>@UUID[RollTable.P3ion2sd0FjY7Lpr]{AV:E - Random Encounters}</p><h4>Corresponding to the Vaults</h4><p>As you can see, I have tried to design this list to that it roughly corresponds with the occupants of the different levels of the vaults. You might also notice that there is no trivial-threat encounter for a 2nd-level party, nor an extreme-threat encounter for an 11th-level party. This is intentional, but feel free to add your own.</p><h4>Encounter Scenario</h4><p>As for how to actually run random encounters, it will vary depending upon which creatures are involved. In most cases, the creatures should be hostile and beyond reasoning. The party may have fortified their position, giving them an advantage; this is fine. Most of these creatures will fight to the death, but some of them may retreat and perhaps even stalk the party or try again later.</p>"

					"the-red-holiday": {
						"title": "The Red Holiday",
						"content": "<h2>Forward</h2><p>When I was first learning about the Abomination Vaults adventure path, I was excited to hear that it included a combat arena. I’ve had great success with things like that in the past. So I was disappointed to read that the arena in the 5th/6th levels is defunct, with only a single combat encounter. This is my solution. Read on if you like the idea of a more active arena in the vaults.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>A couple hundred years after Belcorra’s defeat, a wandering rakshasa discovered the abomination vaults, drawn by the scent of blood, violence, and death. This rakshasa had the head of a vulture, and like a vulture he was drawn to carnage. When he discovered the empty, unused arena, he set up shop and began the work of restoring it back into a fully-functioning coliseum. Both Jafaki and Urevian allowed, or even encouraged this. This outsider was never hired by Belcorra, but he nevertheless is training warriors – or at least providing combat data, as the warriors usually meet a gruesome end. The rakshasa advertises throughout the nearby reaches of the Darklands, and by special agreement with Urevian he also has the ability to transport monsters to and from special holding cells, similar to the statis chambers in the seventh level. The PCs will be unable to access the secret passageways into the Darklands, and they will also be unable to reach these special holding cells. Because of this, you need make few, if any changes to the maps.</p><h2>Changes</h2><p>One recommended change to the official content is that the former arena administrator, @Actor[Chafkhem]{Chafkhem}, was trapped in area <strong>E17</strong> on the <strong>5th level</strong> by this rakshasa, not @Actor[Szek]{Szek}, though possibly he still blames <strong>Jafaki</strong>. He might give the party the rather difficult assignment of slaying the rakshasa.</p><p>The rakshasa’s name is unknown, but the residents of the vaults call him the @UUID[Actor.4q9EP8Kio0Li5tlZ]{Cheery Man}. This is because he typically assumes a brightly-clothed humanoid form, but he always wears an eerie smiling mask. The Cheery Man is constantly on the lookout for new competitors in his arena, and he is driven by a singular goal: to witness violence and death, and to make a big show of it in the meantime. He named his arena the Red Holiday.</p><h2>Cheery Man Appearances</h2><p>The Cheery Man will begin appearing on the upper levels during dangerous fights, watching and observing the heroes. At first, he will simply flee if noticed or pursued, but as the heroes gain his interest by winning tough battles, he will begin to mock the party during fights, offering sarcastic and discouraging commentary. Eventually he will wonder out loud if they have what it takes to compete in the Red Holiday! The Cheery Man should come across as maniacal and unhinged.</p><hr /><p><em>You can use the following hum as a motif for his appearances @UUID[Playlist.dNvE9e5NYjOkeFRB.PlaylistSound.tDHKGg3Qzx5uxofM]{Cheery Man's Hum}.</em></p><hr /><p><em><strong>If you use XP leveling</strong>, the Red Holiday could unbalance your game if the party spends too long there. If you are concerned about this, simply put a limit on how many solo/group encounters they are allowed.</em></p>"
					},
					"the-arena": {
						"title": "The Arena",
						"content": "<h2>The Arena</h2><p>When the heroes arrive at the arena, either on the 5th or 6th level, the Cheery Man will be there to introduce them to the rules, which are as follows: players can compete in <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">solo 1-v-1 battles</span></span>, or <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">as a group</span></span> against more numerous or dangerous foes. The reward in either case is gold and their choice of a magic item. For both solo and group battles, the players can choose between three difficulties:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Good Odds</strong> (a medium-threat encounter)</p></li><li><p><strong>Fair Odds</strong> (a severe-threat encounter),</p></li><li><p>and <strong>Dead Odds</strong> (an extreme-threat encounter).</p></li></ul><p>Use the tables below for suggested encounters and rewards. Make sure that the players understand the severity of a Dead Odds fight, especially in a solo battle, where a bad hero-monster matchup could mean certain death!</p><h3>Breaking the Rules</h3><p>The party might decide to break the rules, such as by leaping into the arena to aid an ally in a solo battle. If this happens, the Cheery Man will also enter the fray, which could spell doom for the party. The Cheery Man might let them go, but ban them from future involvement in the Red Holiday. You might decide that the party can get themselves back into his good graces somehow.</p><h3>Fighting the Cheery Man</h3><p>The Cheery Man is the final boss of the arena. There is no need to defeat him to continue the adventure; indeed, doing so puts an end to the Red Holiday. He has the stats of an elite rajah rakshasa. As loot, he has the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.tNue4PqJe85ZEE5v]{Bloodletting Kukri} magic item (<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">which already exists on </span><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">level 6</span></strong></span>; just <strong>move it</strong> to the Cheery Man), a @UUID[Actor.4q9EP8Kio0Li5tlZ.Item.ykksh2PKlzUdlURz]{Cape of the Mountebank} (which he uses to escape from the party if he is ever pursued outside of the Red Holiday), and a unique magic item called @UUID[Item.wyqLHqkBtDGNOuvV]{The Cheery Man’s Mask}.</p><p>This mask is a worn item, and can be activated once per day by the wearer. Activating the mask is a <span class=\"action-glyph\">F</span> free action which occurs at the start of the wearer’s turn and acts as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.G56DJkxlUjFv0C4Z]{Time Beacon} spell. This powerful and tricky item is also useful outside of combat, but will be used against the party if they ever battle the Cheery Man.</p><p>The Cheery Man will require the party to prove themselves with a few battles in the arena before he accepts any challenge from them. He's not interested in easily destroying his foes. He wants a good fight.</p><h3>The Audience</h3><p>There is typically not much of an audience in the area, but the Cheery Man takes care of that. He uses powerful illusion magic to simulate a roaring crowd filling the stands. Make sure to hype it up and describe how the crowd gasps when the heroes critically fail and cheers when a monster is slain.</p>"

She is stoic, humorless, and a 9th-level wizard.</p><h4>Violence Is Not The Answer</h4><p>You should strongly discourage the PCs from attempting to resolve this side quest through violence. Make it clear to them that force is not the answer here. The <strong>Athenaeum Archives</strong>, a rather fancy old structure of marble and oak, is guarded by 5 @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.Actor.7UBCht1tQfeba2Ih]{wood golem}s. Your party could likely handle one or two in combat, but certainly not all of them, and they will each arrive in [[/r 1d8]] rounds if the PCs force initiative to be rolled. Furthermore, at night there are several watchmen on patrol (using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.npc-gallery.Actor.TgeUj2IiyoTeZHIO]{Watch Officer} NPC stat blocks).</p><h4>The Party Fights the Librarian</h4><p>In the event that the <strong>head librarian</strong> is attacked, she will simply @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.VlNcjmYyu95vOUe8]{Translocate} away and call for backup.</p><ul><li><p>In the event that the PCs wind up in a fight they cannot win, make sure to offer them surrender.</p></li><li><p>If they surrender, they are slapped with a hefty fine and prison time, as well as lifetime bans from the <strong>Archives</strong>.</p></li><li><p>After a few days in the slammer, @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.hm08DkExTcYAkyIg]{Morlibint} and @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.Ez5qEE27mhH5dbKy]{Vandy Banderdash} will arrive to help.</p></li><li><p><strong>Morlibint</strong> puts his career on the line, guaranteeing the safety of the book and the responsible use of its contents; meanwhile <strong>Vandy</strong> makes an argument that this is a church matter, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.8Oy4qHylOOp79JxD]{Nhimbaloth} being involved. They get the book, but the PCs owe them.</p></li><li><p>That probably won’t happen.</p></li></ul><h4>Convincing the Librarian</h4><p>In their meeting with <strong>Caiaphax Yond</strong>, the PCs have a chance to convince her to let them borrow @Item[Thresholds of Truth]. This takes the form of a skill challenge. In a skill challenge, players can roll any skill they think might be helpful. Encourage them to be creative, but you are the ultimate arbiter of what skills may apply here. Charisma-based skills, lore skills, and even others such as Society might be helpful, but Yond is unlikely to be convinced by a display of acrobatics. The only rule here is that any PC cannot attempt the same skill more than once. Try to make sure that all players are involved, giving everyone a chance to try a different tactic.</p><p>If the party reaches three failed checks, they lose. Yond has made up her mind and will listen to no further attempts to convince her. If the party achieves <strong>four</strong> successes before reaching three failures, Yond is convinced. She will allow them to borrow the book for a sufficient amount of time (say, a month or two).</p><p>She is not easy to convince, however! The default DC for any check made in the skill challenge is <strong>DC</strong> <strong>26</strong>.</p><p>If there is a wizard in the party, lower the DC for all checks to <strong>DC</strong> <strong>24</strong> (You might adjust the DC in other special circumstances, such as if a PC is also a librarian.)</p><p>If the party is behaving in a silly or irresponsible manner, increase the DCs to <strong>DC</strong> <strong>28</strong>. </p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">If the party </span><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">succeeds</span></strong>, congratulations! That’s all. They can take the book, which is described in the @UUID[JournalEntry.ZPTalN8eYZyKYfz0.JournalEntryPage.LyGMJmON0ZPU7CmT#thresholds-of-truth]{Roseguard Relics} portion of this document. <strong>Caiaphax Yond</strong> might warn the party about the potential dangers of looking too deeply into the lore of the Outer Gods. After all, it is believed that <strong>Zarmavdian</strong> went mad from his research, and removed himself from the world so as not to cause great harm in his madness.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">If the party </span><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">fails</span></strong> the skill challenge, then it’s on to @UUID[.VuwiUll6ayEz5Tcb]{The Heist}!</p>"

						"title": "Absalom Expedition",
						"content": "<h2>The Great Absalom Spellbook Obtainment Expedition</h2><p>Where is <strong>Zarmavdian</strong>’s grimoire, @Item[Thresholds of Truth]? In the adventure as-written, it is simply in the possession of @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.hm08DkExTcYAkyIg]{Morlibint} right in Otari. However, I prefer to put it in <strong>Absalom</strong>, and make it a bit more difficult to acquire. Why?</p><ul><li><p><strong>Absalom</strong> is the city which is in danger throughout this adventure. This is the city <strong>Belcorra</strong> hates and has devoted herself to destroying. The players should at least see it once.</p><p>You can (and should) show the players the region known as the <strong>Cairnlands</strong>. On the outskirts of <strong>Absalom</strong> lie fields of countless dead, where many sieges in the past have failed. This should drive home the threat of the <strong>Gauntligh</strong>t, if its full power is ever unleashed.</p></li><li><p>There is no real travel in the adventure as-written. This is a chance to have roadside encounters if you want them.</p></li><li><p>The Absalom trip, as presented here, is not combat-oriented, and gives players a chance to utilize other skills.</p></li></ul><h3>Timeframe</h3><p>This side quest should take a session or less. If you are concerned about your players becoming distracted in the big city, send along @UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.hm08DkExTcYAkyIg]{Morlibint},@UUID[JournalEntry.8BpPfc3CFGBW8HMj.JournalEntryPage.timb1zZ8f6zdPbL7]{ Narala}, or another NPC to keep them on track. You can also simply tell your players that they shouldn’t dally for too long in <strong>Absalom</strong>. At this point in the adventure they should understand the threat posed by <strong>Belcorra</strong> and <strong>the Gauntlight</strong>. You should easily be able to maintain a sense of urgency.</p><h3>Where's the Book</h3><p>So. They’re looking for the artifacts of the Roseguard. Three are readily available in or near <strong>Otari</strong>, but only <strong>Morlibint</strong> knows where <strong>Zarmavdian</strong>’s spellbook is held:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Athenaeum Archives</strong>, a private library of magical texts in the city of Absalom.</p></li><li><p>This collection is restricted, its contents open only to certified wizards, students of the arcane, and other scholarly individuals who have received approval.</p></li><li><p>Zarmavdian’s tome is housed here because some of its later contents are said to be a bit…dangerous.</p></li><li><p>It, along with other potentially dangerous books, are in a special guarded collection.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Morlibint</strong> is certain that, with his own signed recommendation, the party will be able to gain an audience with the head librarian (<strong>Caiaphax Yond</strong>). However, they’ll have to convince her to let them borrow @Item[Thresholds of Truth]. If that fails, they’ll be forced to resort to more underhanded methods.</p><h3>The Journey</h3><p>The journey to <strong>Absalom</strong> can be as eventful as you like. If you intend to incorporate the <strong>Leadbuster Lads</strong> from <em>Troubles in Otari</em>, this may be a good time to either introduce them as highwaymen on the road, or to hint at their presence and activities.</p><p>Make sure to describe the <strong>Cairnlands</strong> when the party nears the walls of <strong>Absalom</strong>. They should know by now that the <strong>Gauntlight</strong> at full power will be able to raise powerful undead over a vast area. They also know that meticulous plains have been laid for obtaining maximal strategic use of this power. Seeing the fields where millions have fallen through the ages, you might even describe a terrible vision of immense hordes of undead ravaging the city. You can further drive this home by commenting upon the large graveyards within the city walls, recalling memories of the <strong>Deadtide for Otari</strong> event.</p><p>The <strong>Athenaeum Archives</strong> are, fortunately, not far from the western walls of the city. Your party might wish to find a nearby inn. I’m sure you have no shortage of inns from past games which you can insert here! I used the <strong>Wind Fisher Inn</strong>. It is easily identifiable by its windmills (which always seem to turn, even without wind), and you can rent out kites to fly at the nearby park, which is also adjacent to the <strong>Athenaeum Archives</strong>.</p>"

					"the-heist": {
						"title": "The Heist",
						"content": "<p><em>Editor's Note: As presented in AV:E this section is very rough, I'd recommend you refer to the </em><a href=\"https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=3059&amp;Redirected=1\"><em>Infiltration Rules</em></a><em> as possible way to run it off the following inspiration. I would rewrite this section as well, but that is a larger undertaking than I plan to take cuirrently.</em></p><h2>Heists</h2><p>Heists do not have to be complicated. Since we don’t want to make too big a deal of this sidequest, we will have only four simple obstacles for the players to overcome. Here they are, along with some common/obvious ways of dealing with them. Use these as a sort of checklist that the party has to fill out before they can grab the goods.</p><h3>Stages of the Heist</h3><ol><li><p>Enter the building (presumably at night, when it’s closed)</p><ul><li><p>[[/act pick-a-lock]]{Pick the lock}</p></li><li><p>[[/act steal]]{Steal a key}</p></li><li><p>Enter through an unlocked window on the top floor</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Get past the night watchmen, and the wizards/students who have stayed for some late-night studying</p><ul><li><p>@Check[Stealth|traits:secret]</p></li><li><p>[[/act impersonate]]{Disguise}</p><p>@Check[Deception]</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.GkmbTGfg8KcgynOA]{Create a Diversion}</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Overcome the magical wards guarding the restricted collection, where the dangerous books are kept</p><ul><li><p>@Check[Thievery] or @Check[Arcana] checks to disable the alarms</p></li><li><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]{Dispel magic}</p></li><li><p>Enter by some other means than the one obvious door</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Find @UUID[Item.i4QwUOvRkRGURGBk]{Thresholds of Truth} in the restricted section. There aren’t many books here, but they can be hazardous. Some of the books are dangerous because of the information they contain, others because they will explode, will try to eat an incautious player, or will threaten to sound an alarm unless they are set free. This obstacle is mainly about the time it takes to find the correct book, and is a great place to introduce complications if the heist has been going too smoothly.</p><ul><li><p>If the party has done their research, they should know what Thresholds of Truth looks like, making the search much easier</p></li><li><p>@Check[Arcana] or @Check[Perception] checks can hasten the process</p></li></ul></li></ol><h4>The Prize</h4><p>Then, of course, they’ll have to get out with their prize. It is 2 Bulk, so someone might end up dealing with the Encumbered condition. <strong>Thresholds of Truth</strong> is described in the Roseguard section of this document.</p><h4>Complications</h4><p>Here are some potential complications you can throw at your players:</p><ul><li><p>A student studying late mistakes the PCs for new library staff and starts asking questions.</p></li><li><p>The head librarian comes in for a bit of emergency midnight research on some serious but unrelated topic.</p></li><li><p>A wizard’s familiar notices the party’s heist operation while it prowls the library in boredom. It follows along to watch, and potentially draws attention on purpose to make things more interesting.</p></li></ul><p>Do not be afraid to let players find inventive ways around these obstacles. If one or more players has an ability such as invisibility that trivializes certain obstacles, great! Let them be cool. Just make sure they can’t breeze past <em>everything</em>.</p><h3>The Importance of Multiple States of Failure</h3><p>Finally, there is an important trick to running tense and interesting stealth encounters: <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">having many points of failure.</span> Consider the following scenario:</p><ul><li><p>A player is sneaking through the library and fails a stealth check. The GM decides that this means the guard spots them, and initiative is rolled!</p></li></ul><p>This is no good. For one thing, the entire operation is essentially a failure the moment that combat breaks out. Adjudicating a stealth mission in this manner means that the entire party must roll perfectly in order for the mission to succeed! For another thing, it’s not very interesting or exciting narratively. Finally, it gives few if any choices to the player who failed the roll.</p><p>Instead, consider the following scenario:</p><h4>Example of Multiple States of Failure</h4><p>The thief attempts to sneak through the library past the patrolling guards. They fail their Stealth check! (Meaning that their result does not beat the guards’ @Check[perception|dc:18|traits:secret])</p><p><strong>GM</strong></p><p class=\" box-text narrative\">The guard hears something and comes to investigate, suspicious. He is getting closer, and on the alert. What do you do?</p><p>The thief decides to place a book on the floor, hoping the guard will think it fell to make the noise, and hides in the shadows. They roll stealth. (Or the GM rolls, as this is a secret check.) They fail again.</p><p><strong>GM:</strong></p><p class=\" box-text narrative\">The guard is now convinced that someone is here. He calls for backup and approaches. He still doesn’t see you, but he is searching the darkness and getting very close. What do you do?</p><p>The thief doesn’t want to start a fight, and decides that their best bet is to slink away before more guards come. They roll stealth again, and fail again.</p><p><strong>GM</strong></p><p class=\" box-text narrative\">The guard spots you, shining his lantern in your direction! ‘Who goes there,’ he cries, weapon drawn.</p><p>The thief decides to play dumb. They step from the shadows and explain that they are a student who fell asleep in the stacks and then got lost. They roll deception. They fail.</p><p>GM</p><p class=\" box-text narrative\">The guard is skeptical. By this time his backup has arrived, and you are facing down two of them. He suggests, firmly, that you had better come with them. He reaches for your arm. What do you do?</p><p>Rather than try to run, the thief decides to play along for now, reasoning (correctly) that opportunities for escape may arise later, especially since their allies are still nearby.</p><h4>Scenario Debrief</h4><p>Our player just managed to fail four checks in a row, and yet the adventure continues, and the operation is not over yet. That was four points of failure. At any juncture, the situation is still salvageable. And that’s the whole point: making it very difficult for the players to reach a true fail-state. Also, this would have been a very exciting moment for the player of the thief, even if they did fail every check, because they constantly had the opportunity to re-evaluate the situation, adapt, and make decisions under pressure.</p><p>Most likely, your players will fail a number of checks in the heist. That’s fine. Your job is to use these failures as opportunities to ramp up tension and introduce complications, while constantly putting the ball back in the party’s court by asking ‘what now?’</p><p>Also, since you don’t really <em>want</em> this particular operation to devolve into combat, you can be very forgiving with how many failures a PC is allowed before that becomes inevitable – if it ever does. It also helps if the watchmen are not trigger-happy. In this case, you might even decide that the only way actual combat happens is if the PCs start it.</p><p>And that’s it! One way or another, your party will get their hands on <strong>Thresholds of Truth</strong>.</p>"

He dreamed of adventure from a young age, and joined up with disreputable sailing crews as soon as he was able. He soon fell in with pirates, and for several years partook of their wickedness.</p><p>One day, they raided the wrong ship, but Otari’s life was spared by a cleric of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.v67fHklTZ6LoU54q]{Caiden Cailean}. This was the turning point in Otari’s life, as he forsook his piratical ways and devoted himself instead to the cause of justice and liberation. Though young, Otari was exceptionally skilled, and he soon became known as the <strong>Sea Hawk</strong> across the Inner Sea due to his habit of swooping down upon slaving vessels seemingly out of nowhere. (The sea hawk, as you know, is another name for the osprey.) Thus the <strong>Osprey Club</strong> in Otari is named after him, and they consider themselves honorable thieves, as Otari was.</p><article class=\"full\"><h2>Vol Rajani</h2><p>Vol Rajani took her ancestral blade, the <strong>Rosa Argentis</strong>, when she was exiled from Nidal. Her family’s symbol was the silver rose, and between the thorny blade and her rose-themed armor, she soon gained a name for herself as the <strong>Rose Knigh</strong>t. She battled her way across the Inner Sea region, participating in arena combat and slaying monsters.</p><p>When the Roseguard first came together, after they all leapt to action to stop a rampaging monster at the Absalom docks, it was Vol Rajani’s idea that they join forces, and it was because of her rose symbol that they decided upon the Roseguard as a name. It was originally Vol’s intention to bring her powerful new allies back to Nidal and reclaim her throne, but over time she lost interest in her old goals. Eventually, during a dramatic moment on one of their adventures, she uttered her famous line: “I would rather be a hero than a princess.”</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h2>Zarmavdiam</h2><p>Zarmavdian, the dwarven wizard, is a figure shrouded in mystery. His origin is unknown, though rumor claims he hails from one of the dwarven sky citadels in the north. Even his true name is unknown, for ‘Zarmavdian’ was a title given to him by a remote tribe in the distant Mwangi Expanse. (Zarmavdian was exceptionally well-traveled.)</p><p>The title Zarmavdian can be roughly translated as ‘<strong>The Watchful One</strong>,’ for Zarmavdian was observant as well as clever, and his tactical foresight saved the day just as often as his mighty spells during the adventures of the Roseguard. Zarmavdian was a bit of an eccentric. He dabbled in everything – cookery, poetry, cartography, all forms of art and craft. The depth of his imagination was profound, and he was constantly on the hunt for secrets and mysteries.</p></article><article class=\"full\"><h2>Aesephna Menhemes</h2><p>Aesephna Menhemes was known as <strong>the Huntress</strong>. She was the youngest of the Roseguard when they first came together, still only a teenager.

If they had been even a few days later, Absalom may have fallen! Even during the battle, they did not fully understand the importance of their actions.</p><p><strong>Otari</strong> “died” during this battle, though as we know, he survived and ended up further down in the vaults. The details on what exactly happened here, as well as the answer to the obvious question of “why didn’t the victorious Roseguard find him afterward?” can be found in my notes on meeting Otari in the fourth level, in that section of this document.</p><h2>Fate of the Roseguard</h2><p>The fate of Otari is known, but what about the rest of the Roseguard? When they believed Otari dead, they turned the full might of their vengeance upon Belcorra and overpowered her.</p><p>Belcorra perished as the fulcrum broke, scattering the lenses. The psychic backlash of this event had two effects:</p><ul><li><p>First, it inflicted the curse of the <strong>Empty Death</strong> upon the three remaining members of the Roseguard – Vol, Zarmavdian, and Aesephna.</p></li><li><p>Second, the souls of those present were partially bound to the lenses! Belcorra’s soul was bound to the black lens, by which she was awoken centuries later.</p></li></ul><p>This had no immediate effect upon the Roseguard, but when they died, instead of becoming ghosts and being consumed by Nimbaloth as is normal for those afflicted with the <strong>Empty Death</strong>, their souls entered a sort of inert stasis due to their link with the lenses.</p><h2>In Remembrance</h2><p>When Belcorra died, the Roseguard were stricken with an incurable curse of Empty Death, and they briefly sensed <strong>Nhimbaloth</strong>. They fled from the Gauntlight in terror, and returned only once to confirm that their friend Otari had perished.</p><p>They founded the town nearby atop some old ruins in the caverns with the intent of taking care of any wandering monsters that might have served Belcorra, and to be ready should Belcorra ever reawaken as Zarmavdian feared – for they had not recovered her body, nor the lenses.</p><p>According to the official story, Aesephna, Vol, and Zarmavdian lived happily ever after in the town of Otari. This is not quite what happened, and some of the NPCs in Otari today (including Morlibint, Wrin, Vandy, and even mayor Oseph) are aware that the truth is darker. For the surviving members of the Roseguard were haunted by nightmares, by thoughts of Nhimbaloth. They lived for another decade or so, long enough for Vol and Aesephna to bear lineages, but their end was far from happy.</p><h2>An Empty Victory</h2><p>Zarmavdian eventually realized that their souls had been bound to some kind of artifact, but he was never able to locate the lenses (which had been taken below by Belcorra’s servants) due to their powerful nondetection magic. Zarmavdian descended steadily into madness as he delved ever deeper into the terrible mysteries of Nhimbaloth. He began devising a ritual designed to free himself and his friends from the accursed lenses, but the ritual was impossible to complete without the lenses. Ultimately, Zarmavdian simply disappeared, leaving behind only his tome, <em>Thresholds of Truth</em>, which was taken into protective custody by wizards in <strong>Absalom</strong>. Some suspect that Zarmavdian removed himself from the world, either by suicide or by self-imposed exile to some distant plane, so that he could not harm anyone in his ever-encroaching madness. Whatever the case, he did die, and his soul now slumbers in the lens.</p><p><strong>Vol Rajani</strong> went mad. Increasingly paranoid and violent, the dark night eventually came when <strong>Aesephna Menhemes</strong> was forced to slay her old friend in order to protect innocent lives.</p><p>Aesephna died soon after, depressed and alone, and she was buried in a vault below the town. A dark spirit, drawn by the taint of the empty death and by Aesephna’s misery and despair at the end of her life, came to inhabit her tomb. The party will have to @UUID[.27pIn9IwcZrGwns2]{deal with this spirit} to retrieve Aesephna’s relic.</p>"

For example, once the preparations are complete, the ritual takes minutes rather than hours.</p></aside><p>The amount of effort it requires to prepare the ritual should be proportional to how interested your players are in such a task. If they like the idea of spending a week of downtime buried in arcane research, consulting ancient tomes and various spirits and whatnot, then have them roll some checks. (Maybe give them a bonus if they have <strong>The Whispering Reeds</strong> and if they communicate with Zarmavdian.) Otherwise, they could just hand <strong>Thresholds of Truth</strong> to <strong>Morlibint</strong>, <strong>Wrin</strong>, or possibly even <strong>Vandy</strong>, and those NPCs will get it sorted out.</p><p>Regardless, as the ritual is being prepared and/or researched, a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-monster-core.Actor.5KstOkXabrOlZaKR]{Nosoi} appears to watch, and to offer assistance if it is required. This psychopomp tells you that your efforts have not gone unnoticed in the vast courts of <strong>the Boneyard</strong>. Attempting to free souls from the wreegardless, as the ritual is being prepared and/or wretched gaze of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.8Oy4qHylOOp79JxD]{Nhimbaloth} is a very good thing in the eyes of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.QZD0u1jxwz0kj8uI]{Pharasma}, Nhimbaloth’s ancient enemy, and the <strong>Nosoi</strong> is here to offer what aid it can.</p><p>When the party is ready, they can attempt the ritual. The <strong>Nosoi</strong> will forewarn them to be ready, as this might draw unwanted attention.</p><h3>Assistants</h3><p>First, the party must select NPC assistants to help with the casting of the ritual. This ritual is a matter of the divine, the occult, and the arcane all in one. Therefore, <strong>Wrin</strong>, <strong>Morlibint</strong>, and/or <strong>Vandy</strong> are all options.</p><h3>Location</h3><p>Second, the location. The ritual <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">must take place within 200 feet of the </span><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Gauntlight</span></strong></span>. The most natural location is @JournalEntry[D: Belcora's Retreat]{area D14, Jaul's Pavilion} on the fourth level, because that is close to where Otari’s bones are. The party will have to move his bones elsewhere if they want to conduct the ritual in some other location. The ritual requires a lot of space, so only a few other places within the vaults are viable, such as the arena or the <strong>Darklands</strong> caverns (though levels 8 and 9 are inadvisable, as Belcorra herself might make an appearance). The surface near the Gauntlight keep is also a good choice.</p><h3>Flavor</h3><p>Third, the flavor. Go nuts with all the arcane instruments, occult symbolism, wizardly runes, guttering candles, etc. This ritual is 99% percent preparation, 1% action. There might be chanting, incense, open books everywhere, whatever your players like. The ritual circle is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">ten feet across</span></span>, and the only components that are truly necessary are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Lenses with the Roseguard in them (all but the Ebon Fulcrum Lens)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Thresholds of Truth</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Otari’s bones</strong></p></li></ul><h3>Ritual Prelude</h3><p>And finally, the ritual itself! <em>Things will get interesting</em>.</p><p>The chosen NPC allies will begin with the finale of the ritual: chanting, summoning energies, casting spells. The PCs can assist. All is going well, until…</p><h3>The Neolithid</h3><p>With a terrible screech and a burst of dark energy, a monstrous wormlike creature appears! This is a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.Actor.wxBQsGLdti2xcGVT]{Neothelid} – a foe that is very likely beyond the ability of the party to deal with. It communicates its purpose: it is a servant of Nhimbaloth (as well as the progenitor of the <strong>seugathi</strong> that the party faced in the 6th level), and it is here to stop all this nonsense. The <strong>Nosoi</strong> immediately vanishes.</p><p>The party must defend their allies performing the ritual! Let them fight the neothelid for a single round – just long enough to put the fear of Nhimbaloth into them.</p><h3>The Morrigna Strkes Back</h3><p>But at the end of the first round, the nosoi returns – with backup. A mighty psychopomp known as a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-monster-core.Actor.z9jEyLrsoBMmh9qg]{Morrigna} appears to face off against the neothelid. A raging battle ensues, which is just a bit above the level at which the party can meaningfully contribute. This battle will continue in the background, symbolizing the struggle between <strong>Nhimbaloth</strong> and <strong>Pharasma</strong>, throughout the remainder of the ritual.</p><h3>Revenge of the Void</h3><p>But the party has their own problems, because the Neothelid seems to have opened some kind of path for other servants of Nhimbaloth. As the Morrigna appears, so does a familiar foe: a @Actor[Voidglutton]! The party might have voidglutton-induced PTSD at this point, so it’s good for them to have a chance to strike back at a monster which very possibly has the blood of one or two PCs, if not a whole party, on its seven-fingered hands. (This is an <strong>Elite Voidglutton</strong> if you’re running the vaults a level ahead.)</p><h3>Encounter Routine</h3><p>So here’s how the encounter works: at the start of each round after the morrigna appears, a new elite voidglutton joins the battle. This will continue until the ritual is complete.</p><ul><li><p>The ritual takes <strong>16</strong> rounds to complete.</p></li><li><p>Adjust to <strong>12</strong> if you have only one PC that can easily contribute to the ritual</p></li><li><p>Or <strong>20</strong> if you have three or more</p></li></ul><h4>Aiding the Ritual</h4><p>@Embed[Item.GKFs88le5cqZrSd7]{Aid the Ritual}</p><p>The encounter is a balancing act between dealing with the voidgluttons so as not to be overwhelmed by their ever-increasing numbers, while also hastening the completion of the ritual. The voidgluttons theoretically are attempting to disrupt the NPC who is the primary caster for the ritual, but they will actually target the party.</p><p>Additionally, roll a d8 on this table at the end of each round to determine the effect, if any, that the nearby conflict between neothelid and morrigna has on the battle. These affect both the party and the voidgluttons, unless otherwise specified.</p><p>@Embed[RollTable.wOtgdUeDp6f0TJcf]</p><h3>Aftermath</h3><p>When the ritual is complete, the neothelid will retreat, and any remaining voidgluttons will vanish. The souls of the Roseguard will be separated from the lenses, freed to pass on to the next world. The party’s good deed has been noted by the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.deities.QZD0u1jxwz0kj8uI]{Lady of Graves}. However, the Roseguard ask to help the party finish what the Roseguard began all those centuries ago. As this will thwart Nhimbaloth if successful, the psychopomps agree. They give the party one week before they return to collect the souls of the Roseguard. If the party faces Belcorra in the <strong>Temple of Empty Death</strong> before that time, the spirits of the Roseguard will aid them!</p>"

If the party declines to perform the ritual, they can defeat Belcorra as normal, but the souls of Vol, Aesephna, and Zarmavdian will be forever lost along with her.</p><h2>Roseguard Spirits</h2><p>Any hero who rolls a check to Investigate these lenses will be able to sense a faint non Nhimbaloth presence within them on a @Check[dc:25|type:occultism].

A spirit medium like Wrin, a psychic like Dorianna, or Otari himself can all establish a line of communication with these lost Roseguard spirits, but the connection is faint, like a distant echo. Furthermore, the spirits seem confused, their memories of their lives vague. They have difficulty understanding the current situation, or how much time has passed, and they are consumed by fear of Nhimbaloth and other strong emotions they felt near the ends of their lives. They may still react to especially strong stimuli. (For example, Aesephna might have a heartfelt interaction with her distant descendant, or with Otari.) In general, these three unfortunate spirits should be portrayed as pitiable rather than helpful.</p><h3>Crimson Fulcrum Lens</h3><p><strong>Aesephna Menehemes</strong> is bound to the Crimson Fulcrum Lens. Her spirit will awaken if the lens comes into contact with her cloak or her holy symbol. Otari and Dorianna will also be able to sense her presence and awaken her.</p><h3>Emerald Fulcrum Lens</h3><p><strong>Vol Rajani</strong> is bound to the Emerald Fulcrum Lens. Her spirit will awaken if the lens comes into contact with the Rosa Argentis. Otari and the Rajanis will also be able to sense her presence and awaken her.</p><h3>Ochre Fulcrum Lens</h3><p><strong>Zarmavdian</strong> is bound to the Ochre Fulcrum Lens. His spirit will awaken if the lens comes into contact with his book. Otari will also be able to sense his presence and awaken him. When Zarmavdian is contacted, the party will discover his final ritual in his spellbook – a ritual they can bring to completion to free these heroes of old. The party doesn’t know this, but performing the ritual will also allow the Roseguard heroes to provide aid in the final battle against Belcorra!</p>"
