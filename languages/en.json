Any playthrough will be different, just as every group is different. Every GM will do things a little differently. This is how I did things.</p>\n<p>I have collated most of the changes and additional content I included in my Abomination Vaults game because I know I would have liked to have a resource like this to draw ideas from when I was starting out. In the document, I will explain why I made these changes. You might disagree. That’s fine! Like all such resources, you should take whatever you think will work for your game, and ignore the rest. I hope you can find some of my ideas helpful.</p>\n<p>Here is what this document contains:</p>\n<h3>The Roseguard @UUID[JournalEntry.ZPTalN8eYZyKYfz0]{ }</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        <p>Expanded
