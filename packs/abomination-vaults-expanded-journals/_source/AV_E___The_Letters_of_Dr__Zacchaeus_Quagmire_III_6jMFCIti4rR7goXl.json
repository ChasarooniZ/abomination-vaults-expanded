				"content": "<p>In <strong>The Menace Under Otari</strong>, one piece of loot is only described as a <strong>‘treasure map.’</strong> Obviously, this is intended to provide GMs with a plot hook leading into further adventures. This chapter of <strong>The Abomination Vaults: Expanded</strong> is my effort to elaborate upon this treasure map idea and connect it to the vaults.</p><p>I have changed it from a treasure map to a treasure hunt. The map becomes a letter from an enigmatic character, the first in a series of letters hidden throughout the levels of the Abomination Vaults.</p><section class=\"compartment\"><article class=\"full\"><h3>Dr. Zacchaeus Quagmire III</h3><p>Dr. Zacchaeus Quagmire III is a respected archaeologist and member of the <strong>Inner Sea Historical Society</strong>, based in <strong>Absalom</strong>. Several months ago, he ventured to the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.Y12bRscT79LCpz4k]{Gauntlight} to take a look around, and he ended up discovering the vaults below.</p><p>This was not a problem for him, as he is curious, loves exploring, and is quite capable of taking care of himself. However, because a fortune telling he got from @JournalEntry[Character Biographies#Wrin Sivinxi]{Wrin}, he suspects that his nieces <strong>Theodora</strong> and <strong>Charlotte</strong>, also members of the Historical Society, will be following after him.</p><p>To this end, he has left a series of clues and helpful notes throughout the Vaults. Dr. Quagmire himself can be found and rescued in @JournalEntry[I: Hunting Grounds]{the ninth level}.</p><p>The first note has ended up in the kobolds’ treasure hoard beneath @JournalEntry[Campaign Background#Otari Gazetteer]{Otari} from the <strong>Menace Under Otari</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>If you aren’t running the beginner box adventure, you can have your party find it behind the painting of a tiger in area @JournalEntry[AV:E - Changes to the Vaults#B06. Tiger Painting]{B6} in @JournalEntry[B: Servants' Quarters]{the second level} of the vaults.</p></li></ul><figure class=\"right\"><img src=\"modules/abomination-vaults-expanded/assets/characters/dr._quagmire.avatar.webp\" width=\"220\" /><figcaption><strong>@UUID[Compendium.abomination-vaults-expanded.abomination-vaults-expanded-actors.Actor.2UzvkuwZaWinkwWv]{Dr. Zacchaeus Quagmire III}</strong></figcaption></figure><p>• Each letter is difficult to find without the clues from the previous letter, and each is accompanied by a handful of useful alchemical items or other consumables. More importantly, each letter contains some cryptic clues and hints about what lies further below.</p><p>• @JournalEntry[Otari Locations#Wrin's Wonders]{Wrin} can describe <strong>Dr. Quagmire</strong> as halfling archaeologist who dropped by her place several months ago. At this time she already harbored suspicions about the Gauntlight, but he did not heed her warnings. Part of his fortune told that his nieces would come looking for him.</p><p>• @JournalEntry[Otari Locations#Odd Stories]{James Morlibint} can also be of assistance. He can identify the tome mentioned in the first letter, and he also knows the name of <strong>Dr. Zacchaeus Quagmire III</strong>. In fact, <strong>Morlibint</strong> has one of Dr. Quagmire’s books, <em>Tombs and Temples</em>, which reveals a bit about the adventurous nature of this old archaeologist.</p></article></section>",
