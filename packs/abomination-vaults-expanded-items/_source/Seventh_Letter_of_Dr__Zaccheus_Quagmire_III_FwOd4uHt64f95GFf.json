I am hastily writing this letter, but my pursuers may be closing in even as I do so. I hate to admit it, but it may have been a bit reckless of me to come down this far without waiting for you.<br /><br />Never fear, however! I have come out of worse scrapes than this, I am sure. There is an old hunting lodge down below, you see, and I seem to have inadvertently disturbed a group of caligni warriors.<br /><br />It seems we have reached an upper region of the Darklands. All structures nearby seem built intentionally around the central column. I have reason to believe that it does indeed have a base, and that this base is not far below. One can only speculate what secrets, what mysteries it may contain!<br /><br />A bit of advice if you descend to the lower level: the drow can be reasoned with; the urdefhan can not. As usual, beware of monsters, but they are particularly fierce below. As well, a ghostly spirit of extraordinary power prowls these caverns. You may have noticed. She is rather angry about something.<br />Ah, it seems that my time is running out. Charlotte and Theodora, I love you both dearly.</p><p class=\"parchment-note-1 message\" style=\"font-size:20px\"><br />Ever onward!<br /><br />Your Increasingly Cautious Uncle,</p><p class=\"parchment-note-1 message\" style=\"font-size:20px\">Dr. Zacchaeus Quagmire</p>"
