You know how I just can’t stand fiends, generally – remember the incident with old Colonel Cormorant? But devils aren’t so bad, as far as they go. They won’t jump straight to killing you if they think they can get something from you – and that, my dears, is basic economics. Why, they’re nearly civilized. </p><p class=\"message\" style=\"font-size:20px\"><br />They will, however, most likely get around to killing you at some point, so be ready for that. At least it’s nice and warm down here! I’m sure you two enjoyed the sauna on the arena level, despite the questionable company. Well, I left my next letter in the warmest room down here, right under the circle. Why, I had a fine discussion with the devils in there about the theory behind extraplanar portals. That was before they got around to trying to kill me, of course, as I mentioned above.</p><p class=\"message\" style=\"font-size:20px\"><br />I’m sure you’ll enjoy meeting the boss devil. You always hear talk about heavenly choirs and angelic choruses and whatnot, but you never hear about the more infernal vocalists. Never fear, you’ll get an earful down here! What a musical place this is turning out to be. It is just as I have always said: never judge a sinister multi-level subterranean supercomplex by the squalid ruination of its uppermost level.</p><p class=\"message\" style=\"font-size:20px\"><br />Ever onward!</p><p class=\"message\" style=\"font-size:20px\"><br />Your Evasive Uncle,</p><p class=\"message\" style=\"font-size:20px\">Dr. Zacchaeus Quagmire III</p>"
