It is quite indestructible. How interesting! There is deep magic at work here. I hope that wolf man over to the east didn’t give you any trouble. That is, I hope you didn’t give him any trouble. He seems rather sad. I say, what he needs is some fresh air. It is rather musty down here.</p><p class=\"message\" style=\"font-size:20px\"><br />And speaking of must, you simply must have a look at the arena below! It is straight south from the large stairwell. Charlotte, I am sure you will have a wonderful time. Perhaps you have already taken care of those beasts in the secret chamber northwest of here. Rest assured, there are numerous monsters below, including many unfortunates who have undergone abhorrent experimentation.</p><p class=\"message\" style=\"font-size:20px\"><br />This place has seen better days. A number of abandoned living quarters are clustered together near the middle of the level below. One of them is not quite as abandoned as you might hope! It reminds me of old granny Phyllis’s cooking. I left something for you in the third bedroom counter-clockwise from that one.</p><p class=\"message\" style=\"font-size:20px\"><br />Ever onward!</p><p class=\"message\" style=\"font-size:20px\"><br />Your Inquisitive Uncle, Dr. Zacchaeus Quagmire III</p>"
